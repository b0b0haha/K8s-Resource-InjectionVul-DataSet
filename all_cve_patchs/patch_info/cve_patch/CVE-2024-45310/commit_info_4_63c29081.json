    "message": "rootfs: try to scope MkdirAll to stay inside the rootfs\n\nWhile we use SecureJoin to try to make all of our target paths inside\nthe container safe, SecureJoin is not safe against an attacker than can\nchange the path after we \"resolve\" it.\n\nos.MkdirAll can inadvertently follow symlinks and thus an attacker could\nend up tricking runc into creating empty directories on the host (note\nthat the container doesn't get access to these directories, and the host\njust sees empty directories). However, this could potentially cause DoS\nissues by (for instance) creating a directory in a conf.d directory for\na daemon that doesn't handle subdirectories properly.\n\nIn addition, the handling for creating file bind-mounts did a plain\nopen(O_CREAT) on the SecureJoin'd path, which is even more obviously\nunsafe (luckily we didn't use O_TRUNC, or this bug could've allowed an\nattacker to cause data loss...). Regardless of the symlink issue,\nopening an untrusted file could result in a DoS if the file is a hung\ntty or some other \"nasty\" file. We can use mknodat to safely create a\nregular file without opening anything anyway (O_CREAT|O_EXCL would also\nwork but it makes the logic a bit more complicated, and we don't want to\nopen the file for any particular reason anyway).\n\nlibpathrs[1] is the long-term solution for these kinds of problems, but\nfor now we can patch this particular issue by creating a more restricted\nMkdirAll that refuses to resolve symlinks and does the creation using\nfile descriptors. This is loosely based on a more secure version that\nfilepath-securejoin now has[2] and will be added to libpathrs soon[3].\n\n[1]: https://github.com/openSUSE/libpathrs\n[2]: https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/releases/tag/v0.3.0\n[3]: https://github.com/openSUSE/libpathrs/issues/10\n\nFixes: CVE-2024-45310\nSigned-off-by: Aleksa Sarai <cyphar@cyphar.com>",
