    "message": "security: Add functions to limit max PEM sizes allowable\n\nIncludes a lot of comments explaining how the maxima were calculated.\nThis is _very_ conservative, and assumes we're dealing with RSA keys\ntwice the size of what we actually allow as a maximum.\n\nFrom running the included benchmark it seems the pathological runtime is\nabout 13617196ns (13ms) on an M2 Max which seems acceptable.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ashley Davis <ashley.davis@venafi.com>",
