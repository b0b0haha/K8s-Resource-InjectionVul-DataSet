  "cve_id": "CVE-2021-30465",
  "description": "runc before 1.0.0-rc95 allows a Container Filesystem Breakout via Directory Traversal. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be able to create multiple containers with a fairly specific mount configuration. The problem occurs via a symlink-exchange attack that relies on a race condition.",
