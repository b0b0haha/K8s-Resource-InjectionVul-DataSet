  "cve_id": "CVE-2025-32445",
  "description": "Argo Events is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes. A user with permission to create/modify EventSource and Sensor custom resources can gain privileged access to the host system and cluster, even without having direct administrative privileges. The EventSource and Sensor CRs allow the corresponding orchestrated pod to be customized with spec.template and spec.template.container (with type k8s.io/api/core/v1.Container), thus, any specification under container such as command, args, securityContext , volumeMount can be specified, and applied to the EventSource or Sensor pod. With these, a user would be able to gain privileged access to the cluster host, if he/she specified the EventSource/Sensor CR with some particular properties under template. This vulnerability is fixed in v1.9.6.",
