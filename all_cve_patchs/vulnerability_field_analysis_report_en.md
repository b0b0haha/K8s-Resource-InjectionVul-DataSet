# Kubernetes Vulnerability Field Attribute Analysis Report

## Overview

This report analyzes the impact of Kubernetes vulnerability field characteristics on fix complexity. The analysis is based on 125 vulnerability samples.

### Data Summary
- Total vulnerability count: 125
- Negative fix time vulnerability count: 90 (72.00%)
- Average fix time: 44.09 days
- Average commit count: 2.26

## 1. Field Location Analysis

Impact of field location on vulnerability fix complexity:

| Field Location | Vulnerability Count | Average Injection Field Count | Average Fix Time (Days) | Average Commit Count |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| metadata-annotation | 20 | 1.45 | 10.42 | 1.30 |
| metadata-basic | 3 | 1.00 | nan | 1.33 |
| metadata-label | 3 | 1.00 | 0.10 | 3.00 |
| spec | 96 | 1.12 | 17.33 | 2.50 |
| spec/status | 1 | 2.00 | 998.82 | 2.00 |
| status | 2 | 1.00 | nan | 1.00 |


## 2. Resource Type Analysis

Impact of different resource types (core/custom) on fix complexity:

| Resource Type | Vulnerability Count | Average Injection Field Count | Average Fix Time (Days) | Average Commit Count |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| custom | 43 | 1.19 | 26.33 | 2.93 |
| internal | 82 | 1.17 | 55.93 | 1.91 |


## 3. Field Function Type Analysis

Impact of field function type on fix complexity:

| Function Type | Vulnerability Count | Average Injection Field Count | Average Fix Time (Days) | Average Commit Count |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| application specific | 70 | 1.26 | 73.34 | 1.80 |
| command | 10 | 1.00 | 20.59 | 1.70 |
| path type | 33 | 1.00 | 13.13 | 2.67 |
| resource reference | 12 | 1.33 | 7.13 | 4.33 |


## 4. Key Findings

### Fix Complexity Influencing Factors

1. **Field Location Impact**: Different field locations show variations in average fix time and commit count
2. **Resource Type Impact**: Core and custom resources may have different fix complexity levels
3. **Function Type Impact**: Different function type fields show significant differences in fix difficulty

### Negative Fix Time Handling

- 90 vulnerabilities with negative fix times were identified
- For these vulnerabilities, fix complexity is primarily measured by patch count
- Average commit count is 1.37

## 5. High-Risk Resource Rankings

Resource risk rankings based on vulnerability count and injection field count:

| Rank | Resource Name | Vulnerability Count | Total Injection Field Count | Resource Category |
|------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Pod  | 52 | 58 | internal |
| 2 | Ingress | 14 | 21 | internal |
| 3 | Application | 11 | 11 | custom |
| 4 | ConfigMap | 3 | 3 | internal |
| 5 | Kustomization | 3 | 3 | custom |
| 6 | Node | 3 | 3 | internal |
| 7 | PersistentVolume | 2 | 2 | internal |
| 8 | Service | 2 | 3 | internal |
| 9 | Workflow | 2 | 2 | custom |
| 10 | VirtualMachineInstance | 2 | 2 | custom |


## Conclusions and Recommendations

1. **Focus on High-Risk Resources**: Prioritize security protection for resources with high vulnerability counts and injection field counts
2. **Differentiated Fix Strategies**: Develop different fix strategies based on field location and resource type
3. **Early Warning Mechanisms**: Establish warning mechanisms for high-risk field function types
